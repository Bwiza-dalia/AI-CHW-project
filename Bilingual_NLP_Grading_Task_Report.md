## Executive Summary

This report documents the implementation and evaluation of a bilingual NLP grading system designed for Community Health Worker (CHW) e-learning assessments. The system automatically grades descriptive answers in both English and Kinyarwanda languages using machine learning and semantic similarity techniques. The implementation demonstrates a hybrid approach combining rule-based logic with machine learning models trained on medical question-answering datasets.

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Context
The bilingual NLP grading system is part of a larger AI-powered CHW e-learning platform that aims to provide accessible, localized healthcare training in Rwanda. The system addresses the critical need for automated assessment of CHW knowledge in their native language (Kinyarwanda) while maintaining English language support.

### 1.2 Objectives
- Develop an automated grading system for descriptive answers in medical/healthcare contexts
- Support bilingual assessment (English and Kinyarwanda)
- Provide detailed feedback and scoring (0-5 scale)
- Ensure scalability and offline functionality for resource-constrained environments

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 System Components

#### Core Grading Module (`src/models/grading.py`)
- **Main Function:** `grade_answer(question, reference_answer, user_answer, lang)`
- **Output:** Comprehensive feedback dictionary with score, similarity metrics, strengths, gaps, and suggestions
- **Language Support:** English (en) and Kinyarwanda (ki)

#### Feature Extraction (`extract_features()`)
The system extracts five key features for grading:
1. **TF-IDF Similarity:** Cosine similarity using TF-IDF vectorization
2. **Jaccard Similarity:** Set-based similarity between answer vocabularies
3. **Keyword Density:** Coverage of domain-specific medical terms
4. **Embedding Similarity:** Semantic similarity using sentence embeddings
5. **Answer Length Ratio:** Relative length comparison with reference

#### Machine Learning Model (`grading_train.py`)
- **Algorithm:** Random Forest Regressor
- **Training Data:** MedQuAD dataset (247,753 examples)
- **Features:** 5-dimensional feature vector
- **Output:** Continuous score (0-5) for regression

### 2.2 Language Processing Pipeline

#### Text Normalization (`src/models/utils.py`)
- **Stopword Removal:** Language-specific stopword lists
- **Text Cleaning:** Punctuation removal, lowercase conversion
- **Language Detection:** Heuristic-based language identification

#### Semantic Analysis
- **Primary Method:** Sentence Transformers (paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2)
- **Fallback:** TF-IDF vectorization with consistent vocabulary
- **Synonym Expansion:** WordNet for English, custom mapping for Kinyarwanda

#### Bilingual Support
- **English Keywords:** malaria, prevention, mosquito, bed net, symptoms, treatment
- **Kinyarwanda Keywords:** malariya, kwirinda, umubu, uburiri, ibimenyetso, ubuvuzi
- **Synonym Mapping:** Cross-language concept alignment

## 3. Dataset Analysis

### 3.1 MedQuAD Dataset
- **Total Examples:** 247,753
- **Language Distribution:**
  - English: 5,712 examples (97.8%)
  - Kinyarwanda: 9 examples (0.2%)
  - Other/Unspecified: 242,032 examples (97.6%)

### 3.2 Data Structure
```csv
question,reference_answer,user_answer,lang,score
```

### 3.3 Score Distribution
The dataset includes scores ranging from 1-6, with examples showing:
- **Score 1:** Minimal understanding, very brief answers
- **Score 3:** Partial understanding, incomplete responses
- **Score 5:** Complete understanding, comprehensive answers
- **Score 6:** Exceptional responses (rare)

## 4. Grading Methodology

### 4.1 Scoring Algorithm

#### Hybrid Approach
1. **Off-topic Detection:** Rule-based filtering for completely irrelevant responses
2. **ML Model Prediction:** Random Forest regression for primary scoring
3. **Fallback Scoring:** Cosine similarity mapping when ML model unavailable

#### Score Mapping
```python
def map_similarity_to_score(sim: float) -> int:
    if sim >= 0.85: return 5      # Excellent
    elif sim >= 0.7: return 4     # Good
    elif sim >= 0.5: return 3     # Fair
    elif sim >= 0.3: return 2     # Poor
    elif sim >= 0.15: return 1    # Very Poor
    else: return 0                 # Off-topic
```

### 4.2 Feedback Generation

#### Bilingual Feedback Templates
- **English:** Contextual feedback based on score level
- **Kinyarwanda:** Localized feedback with cultural appropriateness
- **Dynamic Suggestions:** Specific improvement recommendations

#### Feedback Components
- **Score (0-5):** Numerical assessment
- **Similarity:** Cosine similarity metric
- **Strengths:** Correctly identified key concepts
- **Gaps:** Missing important concepts
- **Suggestions:** Actionable improvement steps
