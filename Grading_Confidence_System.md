# Grading System Confidence Scoring
## Technical Documentation

### ðŸŽ¯ **Overview**
The AI grading system now includes confidence scores (0.0 to 1.0) that indicate how certain the AI is about its grading decisions. This helps CHWs understand the reliability of their grades and when to seek additional clarification.

---

## ðŸ”§ **How Confidence is Calculated**

### **Confidence Factors (Weighted Average):**

1. **Similarity Score (40% weight)**
   - Based on semantic similarity between user answer and reference
   - Range: 0.0 to 1.0
   - Higher similarity = higher confidence

2. **ML Model Agreement (20% weight)**
   - Compares ML model prediction with similarity-based score
   - Only available when ML model is present
   - Agreement = 1.0 - |ML_score - similarity_score| / 5.0

3. **Feature Strength (30% weight)**
   - Combines multiple text analysis features:
     - TF-IDF similarity (30%)
     - Jaccard similarity (20%)
     - Keyword density (20%)
     - Embedding similarity (30%)

4. **Score Extremity (10% weight)**
   - Extreme scores (0 or 5) are more confident
   - Scores 1 or 4: 80% confidence
   - Scores 2 or 3: 60% confidence

### **Formula:**
```
Confidence = (Similarity Ã— 0.4) + (ML_Agreement Ã— 0.2) + (Feature_Strength Ã— 0.3) + (Extremity Ã— 0.1)
```

## ðŸ“Š **Confidence Score Interpretation**

| Confidence Range | Meaning | Visual Indicator | Action Required |
|------------------|---------|------------------|-----------------|
| **0.8 - 1.0** | **High** | ðŸŸ¢ Green | AI is very confident in the grade |
| **0.6 - 0.8** | **Medium** | ðŸ”µ Blue | AI is reasonably confident |
| **0.0 - 0.6** | **Low** | ðŸŸ¡ Yellow | AI is uncertain, review recommended |

## ðŸŽ¯ **Real Examples**

### **Example 1: High Confidence (58.6%)**
```
Question: "What are the symptoms of malaria?"
User Answer: "Malaria causes fever, chills, and headache. It can be very serious."
Score: 3/5
Confidence: 58.6%
Similarity: 70.7%
```
**Analysis:** Good similarity but missing some key concepts, resulting in medium confidence.

### **Example 2: Low Confidence (23.9%)**
```
Question: "How can malaria be prevented?"
User Answer: "I dont know"
Score: 1/5
Confidence: 23.9%
Similarity: 0.0%
```
**Analysis:** Very low similarity and off-topic response, resulting in low confidence.

### **Example 3: Medium Confidence (60.0%)**
```
Question: "What is diabetes?"
User Answer: "Diabetes is when your blood sugar is high because your body cant make enough insulin or use it properly."
Score: 2/5
Confidence: 60.0%
Similarity: 94.4%
```
**Analysis:** High similarity but low score due to missing details, resulting in medium confidence.

## ðŸ’¡ **Benefits for CHWs**

### **1. Quality Assurance**
- CHWs know when to trust the AI's grading
- Low confidence alerts indicate need for human review
- Helps identify unclear or ambiguous answers

### **2. Learning Guidance**
- High confidence + low score = clear areas for improvement
- Low confidence = answer may be unclear or off-topic
- Medium confidence = partial understanding, needs refinement

### **3. Self-Assessment**
- CHWs can gauge their own answer quality
- Encourages more detailed, specific responses
- Builds confidence in medical knowledge

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Implementation**

### **Confidence Calculation Function:**
```python
def calculate_grading_confidence(features, similarity, score, ml_score=None):
    confidence_factors = []
    
    # Factor 1: Similarity score (0-1)
    confidence_factors.append(similarity)
    
    # Factor 2: ML model agreement (if available)
    if ml_score is not None:
        similarity_score = map_similarity_to_score(similarity)
        score_agreement = 1.0 - abs(ml_score - similarity_score) / 5.0
        confidence_factors.append(score_agreement)
    
    # Factor 3: Feature strength
    feature_strength = (
        features.get('tfidf_sim', 0) * 0.3 +
        features.get('jaccard_sim', 0) * 0.2 +
        features.get('keyword_density', 0) * 0.2 +
        features.get('emb_sim', 0) * 0.3
    )
    confidence_factors.append(feature_strength)
    
    # Factor 4: Score extremity
    if score == 0 or score == 5:
        extremity_factor = 1.0
    elif score == 1 or score == 4:
        extremity_factor = 0.8
    else:  # score 2 or 3
        extremity_factor = 0.6
    confidence_factors.append(extremity_factor)
    
    # Calculate weighted average
    weights = [0.4, 0.2, 0.3, 0.1] if ml_score else [0.5, 0.0, 0.4, 0.1]
    confidence = sum(w * f for w, f in zip(weights, confidence_factors))
    return min(max(confidence, 0.0), 1.0)
```
